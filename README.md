The automation algorithm is capable of performing three sampling methods and four operations (Statistical sampling has two choices- Threshold and cascade filter). Statistical sampling threshold filter method sort the data according to classes available in individual file and distribution of certain classes. It uses threshold values to filter out files not having required classes and a good enough frequency distribution. The red square in Figure 24 shows how the data is separated into folders according to their distribution and classes. Statistical cum stratified sampling uses statistically separated samples plus certain samples having certain qualities. Water’s classification precision is low, so in fusion methods, we add stratified water to the main samples separated by the statistical sampler or other specific data can also be added. This fusion method, in a way, is an extension of the statistical method; it is shown in Figure 24 under a violet box. What stratified data can be added can be changed, but for this algorithm, it is by default for adding files having a good distribution of “Water” class and “Work of Art” class. The automation algorithm is generalized to take different data as input; that’s why it is designed to take input of 5 most common classes such as vegetation, ground, building, water, and other. However, AHN3 has different definitions of classes. The “Other” class in AHN3 data consists of vegetation, power lines, cars, etc., which will have to be given as input in an algorithm's “Vegetation” variable (See Table 7).
